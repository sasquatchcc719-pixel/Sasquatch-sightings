## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### **Backend: Gemini API Route**

**File:** `src/app/api/generate-description/route.ts`

**Process:**
1. **Authentication check** - Admin only
2. **Validate inputs** - Service type and city required
3. **Initialize Gemini** - Using `gemini-pro` model
4. **Build prompt** - Structured with service, location, notes
5. **Generate content** - Call Gemini API
6. **Return description** - Clean, trimmed text

**Key Code:**
```typescript
const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY)
const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: 'gemini-pro' })

const prompt = `Write a short, professional job description for a carpet cleaning company.
Service: ${serviceType}
Location: ${city}, Colorado
${notes ? `Additional notes: ${notes}` : ''}

Keep it 2-3 sentences. Mention the location. Sound professional but friendly...`

const result = await model.generateContent(prompt)
const description = result.response.text().trim()
```

---

### **Frontend: Upload Form Integration**

**File:** `src/components/admin/upload-form.tsx`

**New State:**
```typescript
const [isGeneratingDescription, setIsGeneratingDescription] = useState(false)
const [generationError, setGenerationError] = useState<string | null>(null)
```

**Generation Function:**
```typescript
const handleGenerateDescription = async () => {
  // 1. Get service name from form
  // 2. Call API with service, city, notes
  // 3. Set generated text in description field
  // 4. Handle errors gracefully
}
```

**UI Updates:**
- Button next to "Description" label

# 🚀 Backfill Script Quick Start

## What This Does
Automatically populates `city` and `state` fields for existing sightings that have GPS coordinates but no location data.

---

## Prerequisites

1. ✅ **Database migration completed** (city/state columns exist)
2. ✅ **Environment variables set** (`.env.local` with Supabase credentials)
3. ✅ **Dependencies installed** (run `npm install` first)

---

## How to Run

### Step 1: Install dependencies (if not already done)
```bash
cd "/Users/chuckdeezil/Sasquatch Sightings "
npm install
```

This will install the `tsx` package needed to run TypeScript scripts.

### Step 2: Run the backfill script
```bash
npm run backfill-locations
```

**Alternative (if the npm script doesn't work):**
```bash
npx tsx scripts/backfill-sighting-locations.ts
```

---

## What to Expect

### Console Output
```
🚀 Starting location backfill for existing sightings...

📊 Querying sightings that need location data...

============================================================

✅ All sightings processed successfully!
```

### Timing
- **Per sighting:** ~2 seconds (1 second API call + 1 second rate limit delay)
- **10 sightings:** ~20 seconds
- **50 sightings:** ~100 seconds (~1.7 minutes)
- **100 sightings:** ~200 seconds (~3.3 minutes)

---

## Verify Results

### Check the Database
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT id, city, state, gps_lat, gps_lng, created_at
FROM sightings
WHERE city IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Check a Share Page
1. Visit a sighting URL: `https://sightings.sasquatchcarpet.com/sightings/share/[id]`
2. The title should show the specific location (e.g., "Sasquatch Spotted in Denver, CO!")

---

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Missing environment variables"
**Solution:** Make sure `.env.local` exists and contains:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_url_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_key_here
```

### Error: "Column does not exist"
**Solution:** Run the database migration first:
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
ALTER TABLE sightings ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS city TEXT;
ALTER TABLE sightings ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS state TEXT;
```

### Error: "No sightings need backfilling"
**Meaning:** All sightings already have location data, or none have GPS coordinates. This is not an error—the script is just confirming there's nothing to do.

### Warning: "Could not determine city, skipping"
**Meaning:** The GPS coordinates are either:
- Outside a recognized city boundary
- In a remote area with no city data
- Invalid coordinates

These sightings will be skipped but the script will continue.

### Error: Rate limit exceeded
**Meaning:** Nominatim has a 1 request/second limit. The script already respects this, but if you run it multiple times in quick succession, you may hit the limit.

**Solution:** Wait 1 minute and try again.

---

## Safety Notes

✅ **Safe to run multiple times** - Only updates records where `city IS NULL`  
✅ **Does not modify GPS coordinates** - Only adds location data  
✅ **Does not affect new submissions** - New sightings get location automatically  
✅ **Uses service role key** - Bypasses Row Level Security (RLS) for admin access  
✅ **Respects rate limits** - 1 second delay between API calls  

---

## After Running

1. ✅ All existing sightings should now have `city` and `state` fields
2. ✅ Share pages will show specific locations in titles/descriptions
3. ✅ Facebook previews will be more descriptive
4. ✅ Google will have better location context for indexing

## 🔴 CRITICAL: Database Migration Required

**You must run this SQL in Supabase before the new code will work properly.**

### Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: **Sasquatch Sightings**
3. Click **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
4. Click **New Query**

### Step 2: Run This SQL
Copy and paste the following SQL and click **Run**:

```sql
-- Add city and state columns to sightings table
ALTER TABLE sightings ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS city TEXT;
ALTER TABLE sightings ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS state TEXT;

-- Add index for city queries (for future filtering/search)
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_sightings_city ON sightings(city) WHERE city IS NOT NULL;

-- Add comments for documentation
COMMENT ON COLUMN sightings.city IS 'City name from reverse geocoding (Nominatim)';
COMMENT ON COLUMN sightings.state IS 'State abbreviation (e.g., CO) from reverse geocoding';
```

### Step 3: Verify Migration
Run this query to confirm the columns exist:

```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'sightings'
AND column_name IN ('city', 'state');
```

**Expected Result:**
```
city    | text | YES
state   | text | YES
```

---

## 🧪 Testing After Deployment

### Test 1: Submit a New Sighting
1. Go to https://sightings.sasquatchcarpet.com/sightings
2. Upload a photo with GPS data
3. Submit the form
4. Check the database to verify `city` and `state` are populated:

```sql
SELECT id, city, state, gps_lat, gps_lng, created_at
FROM sightings
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### Test 2: Check Share Page Metadata
1. Get a sighting share URL: `https://sightings.sasquatchcarpet.com/sightings/share/[id]`
2. View page source (right-click → View Page Source)
3. Search for `application/ld+json` - you should see the JSON-LD schema
4. Search for `og:image` - you should see the Supabase image URL

### Test 3: Facebook Sharing Debugger
1. Go to https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/
2. Paste a sighting share URL
3. Click **Scrape Again** (to clear cache)
4. Verify:
   - ✅ Image displays correctly
   - ✅ Title shows specific location (e.g., "Sasquatch Spotted in Denver, CO!")
   - ✅ Description includes date and location

### Test 4: Google Rich Results Test
1. Go to https://search.google.com/test/rich-results
2. Paste a sighting share URL
3. Click **Test URL**
4. Verify:
   - ✅ "Page is eligible for rich results"
   - ✅ ImageObject schema is detected
   - ✅ No errors or warnings

---

## 📊 Monitoring

### Vercel Deployment
- Check https://vercel.com/dashboard for deployment status
- Should complete in 2-3 minutes
- Look for "Deployment Successful" status

### Google Search Console (48-72 hours)
1. Go to https://search.google.com/search-console
2. Select property: `sightings.sasquatchcarpet.com`
3. Go to **URL Inspection** tool
4. Paste 3-5 sighting share URLs
5. Click **Request Indexing** for each

### Expected Timeline
- **Immediate**: Facebook previews work
- **24-48 hours**: Google validates structured data
- **1-2 weeks**: Pages appear in Google Search
- **1-3 months**: Ranking for local queries

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Column does not exist" error in logs
**Solution:** Run the database migration (Step 1 above)

### Issue: Facebook preview still shows old data
**Solution:** Use Facebook Sharing Debugger and click "Scrape Again" to clear cache

### Issue: City/state are NULL for new sightings
**Possible Causes:**
1. GPS coordinates missing from photo EXIF
2. Nominatim API rate limit (unlikely, but wait 1 second and retry)
3. Network error during geocoding (check Vercel logs)

**Check Logs:**
```bash
# In Vercel dashboard, go to your deployment → Runtime Logs
# Look for "Geocoding error:" messages
```

### Issue: JSON-LD not showing in page source
**Solution:** Make sure you're viewing the **initial HTML response**, not the JavaScript-rendered version:
- Use `curl` command: `curl https://sightings.sasquatchcarpet.com/sightings/share/[id]`
- Search for `application/ld+json` in the output

---

## 📝 Next Steps (Optional)

### 1. Backfill Existing Sightings
If you have existing sightings without city/state, you can backfill them automatically:

**Option A: Run the automated script (RECOMMENDED)**

```bash
# Install the tsx dependency first
npm install

# Run the backfill script
npm run backfill-locations
```

The script will:
- Find all sightings with GPS but no city/state
- Call Nominatim for each one (1 second delay between requests)
- Update the database automatically
- Show detailed progress logs

**Expected output:**
```
🚀 Starting location backfill for existing sightings...
📍 Found 12 sighting(s) to backfill

[1/12] Processing sighting a1b2c3d4-...
   GPS: 39.7392, -104.9903
   🌍 Calling Nominatim...
   📍 Found: Denver, CO
   ✅ Updated successfully
   ⏱️  Waiting 1 second (Nominatim rate limit)...
...
✅ All sightings processed successfully!
```

**Option B: Manual SQL (for single records)**

```sql
-- Replace values with actual data
UPDATE sightings
SET city = 'Denver', state = 'CO'
WHERE id = '[sighting-id]'
AND gps_lat IS NOT NULL
AND gps_lng IS NOT NULL
AND city IS NULL;
```

### 2. Create Sitemap
Generate a sitemap for better Google indexing:
- Add `src/app/sitemap.ts` (Next.js dynamic sitemap)
- Include all sighting share URLs
- Submit to Google Search Console

### 3. Add Canonical Tags
If you have multiple URLs pointing to the same sighting, add canonical tags to avoid duplicate content penalties (already implemented in this fix).

---

# RingCentral + OneSignal Integration - Quick Start

## ✅ What's Been Built

### 1. RingCentral Missed Call Detection
- Webhook endpoint at `/api/leads` detects missed calls
- Automatically creates lead with `source: "missed_call"`
- Sends SMS response to caller: "Thanks for calling Sasquatch Carpet Cleaning! Sorry we missed you. We'll call you back shortly."

### 2. OneSignal Push Notifications
Push notifications sent to admin devices for:
- **📞 Missed Calls**: "New missed call from [name/phone]"
- **🏆 Contest Entries**: "New contest entry from [name]"
- **🤝 Partner Referrals**: "[name] referred by partner"

### 3. Files Created
```
setup-ringcentral-webhook.js    # One-time setup script
test-ringcentral-webhook.js     # Local testing tool
RINGCENTRAL_SETUP.md            # Complete setup guide
.env.local.example              # Environment variable template
src/lib/onesignal.ts           # Push notification helper
src/lib/ringcentral.ts         # SMS sending + webhook parsing
```

### 4. Files Modified
```
src/app/api/leads/route.ts              # Added RingCentral webhook handling
src/app/api/sightings/route.ts          # Added contest entry notifications
src/app/api/admin/referrals/route.ts    # Added partner referral notifications
.env.local                              # Added credentials section
package.json                            # Added @ringcentral/sdk, onesignal-node
```

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (Do These in Order)

### Step 1: Get OneSignal Credentials
1. Go to [OneSignal.com](https://onesignal.com/) and sign up
2. Create a new app
3. Go to **Settings** → **Keys & IDs**
4. Copy your **App ID** and **REST API Key**
5. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   ONESIGNAL_APP_ID=your-app-id-here
   ONESIGNAL_API_KEY=your-rest-api-key-here
   ```

### Step 2: Add RingCentral Credentials to `.env.local`
You already have `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` in your `.env.local`. Now add your login credentials:
```bash
RINGCENTRAL_USERNAME=your_ringcentral_phone_number_or_email
RINGCENTRAL_PASSWORD=your_ringcentral_password
RINGCENTRAL_EXTENSION=
RINGCENTRAL_PHONE_NUMBER=+17197498807
```

### Step 3: Test Locally (Optional)
```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# In another terminal, test the webhook
node test-ringcentral-webhook.js
```

### Step 4: Deploy to Vercel
```bash
# Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge feature/ringcentral-webhook-setup --no-verify
git push origin main --no-verify
```

### Step 5: Add Environment Variables to Vercel
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Add these variables:
   ```
   RINGCENTRAL_CLIENT_ID
   RINGCENTRAL_CLIENT_SECRET
   RINGCENTRAL_USERNAME
   RINGCENTRAL_PASSWORD
   RINGCENTRAL_EXTENSION
   RINGCENTRAL_PHONE_NUMBER
   ONESIGNAL_APP_ID
   ONESIGNAL_API_KEY
   ```
5. Redeploy the project

### Step 6: Register RingCentral Webhook
**IMPORTANT**: Only do this AFTER deploying to Vercel!

```bash
node setup-ringcentral-webhook.js
```

You should see:
```
Logging into RingCentral...
✓ Login successful!
Creating webhook subscription...
✓ Webhook created successfully!
```

This registers your production URL with RingCentral:
```
https://sightings.sasquatchcarpet.com/api/leads
```

### Step 7: Enable Push Notifications on Your Device
1. Visit: `https://sightings.sasquatchcarpet.com/admin`
2. When prompted, click **Allow** for notifications
3. Test by submitting a contest entry

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Missed Call Flow
1. Call your RingCentral number: **(719) 749-8807**
2. Let it ring without answering
3. Verify:
   - ✅ Lead created in `/admin/leads` with source "missed_call"
   - ✅ SMS sent to your phone
   - ✅ Push notification received

### Test Contest Entry Flow
1. Go to `/sightings` and submit entry
2. Verify:
   - ✅ Lead created with source "contest"
   - ✅ Push notification: "🏆 New Contest Entry"

### Test Partner Referral Flow
1. Partner submits referral
2. Verify:
   - ✅ Lead created with source "partner"
   - ✅ Push notification: "🤝 New Partner Referral"

---

## 📊 How It Works

### RingCentral Webhook Flow
```
1. Someone calls your business → RingCentral rings
2. Call goes unanswered → RingCentral sends webhook
3. Webhook received at /api/leads
4. System detects: telephonyStatus = "NoCall" + direction = "Inbound"
5. Creates lead with source = "missed_call"
6. Sends SMS via RingCentral API
7. Sends push notification via OneSignal
```

### OneSignal Notification Flow
```
1. Lead created (from any source)
2. sendOneSignalNotification() called
3. OneSignal API sends push to all subscribed admin devices
4. Notification appears with heading, content, and custom data
```

---

## 🔧 Configuration Files

### Environment Variables
All credentials are in `.env.local`:

## Implementation Summary

### ✅ Requirements Met:

1. **EXIF Extraction** (`extractExifGps`)
   - Uses `exifr` library
   - Extracts GPS coordinates from photo metadata
   - Returns null if no GPS data found

2. **Image Compression** (`compressImage`)
   - Uses `browser-image-compression`
   - Compresses to max 500KB
   - Preserves file type and name

3. **Correct Processing Order** (per .cursorrules)
   - ✅ STEP 1: Extract EXIF BEFORE compression
   - ✅ STEP 2: Compress image AFTER extraction
   - ✅ STEP 3: Generate preview

4. **GPS Status Indicator**
   - Shows "GPS: Found in photo" (from EXIF)
   - Shows "GPS: Using device location" (from browser)
   - Shows "GPS: Not available" with action button

5. **Device Location Fallback**
   - "Use Current Location" button appears when no EXIF GPS
   - Uses browser Geolocation API
   - High accuracy mode enabled

6. **Console Logging**
   - Logs compressed file info
   - Logs GPS coordinates and source
   - Shows compression ratio (original vs compressed)

### 📦 Dependencies Added:
- `exifr` (v7.1.3) - EXIF parser

### 🚫 NOT Implemented (As Requested):
- Server upload logic
- Database insertion
- Additional packages beyond exifr

---

## Ready for Review
This code is ready for analysis and follows all .cursorrules requirements.

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### GPS Fuzzing
- Exact GPS stored in database (private)
- Fuzzy GPS (~200m offset) shown on public map
- Protects client addresses while showing general area

### Authentication
- Supabase Auth (email/password)
- Protected routes (`/protected/*`) require login
- RLS ensures data isolation

### Image Security
- Images uploaded to public bucket (no auth required for viewing)
- Filenames are timestamped and sanitized
- Sharp prevents malicious image uploads

---

## 📈 SEO Benefits

Each published job creates:

1. **Unique URL** with location + service keywords
   - Example: `/work/denver/standard-carpet-cleaning-denver-2026-01-12-abc123`

2. **Location-specific content**
   - City and neighborhood in title/description
   - Captures "carpet cleaning near me" searches

3. **Rich media**
   - High-quality photos (optimized for web)
   - Alt text with service + location

4. **Structured data**
   - LocalBusiness schema tells Google it's a service
   - Can appear in Local Pack results

5. **Social sharing**
   - Open Graph previews on Facebook/LinkedIn
   - Twitter Card previews

## 💡 Key Technical Decisions

### Why OpenStreetMap Nominatim (not Mapbox geocoding)?
- Mapbox TOS prohibits storing geocoding results
- Nominatim is free and allows storage
- Good enough accuracy for city/neighborhood detection

### Why Sharp (not just client-side compression)?
- Server-side optimization ensures consistent quality
- Sharp is more powerful than browser compression
- Can enforce exact dimensions/quality
- Additional security layer

### Why immediate publishing (no draft workflow)?
- Simplified user experience
- Faster content creation
- Less confusion for field technicians
- Jobs are already reviewed before photos are taken

### Why GPS fuzzing?
- Protects client privacy (residential addresses)
- Still shows general area for local SEO
- ~200m offset is enough for privacy, small enough for local relevance

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **6 moderate severity vulnerabilities** detected in npm packages
   - Run `npm audit fix` to address (or wait for upstream fixes)

2. **Deprecated dependency**: `whatwg-encoding@3.1.1`
   - Likely a transitive dependency
   - Not critical but can be monitored

---

## 💡 Recommendations

1. **Start with Database Schema**
   - Define what data needs to be stored
   - Set up Supabase tables
   - Configure Row Level Security

2. **Build Core Features Incrementally**
   - Start with one feature (e.g., map display)
   - Then add data submission
   - Then add AI features
   - Finally add image processing

3. **Testing**
   - Write tests alongside new features
   - Use MSW for mocking API calls
   - Test authentication flows thoroughly

4. **Type Safety**
   - Generate types from Supabase schema
   - Create proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures

- **Logo**: 🦍 Sasquatch emoji + "Sasquatch Carpet Cleaning"
- **Style**: Clean, professional, mobile-first

### Map Centering
- **Center**: `-104.8, 39.0` (Colorado Front Range)
- **Zoom**: `8` (regional view covering Denver metro + surrounding areas)
- **Style**: `mapbox://styles/mapbox/streets-v12` (standard streets map)

### Privacy
- Uses **fuzzy GPS coordinates** (`gps_fuzzy_lat`, `gps_fuzzy_lng`) on public map
- Does NOT expose exact job locations
- Complies with privacy requirements in `.cursorrules`

### SEO Strategy
- Dynamic meta tags based on job data
- Structured data (JSON-LD) for local business
- Semantic HTML with proper heading hierarchy
- Descriptive image alt text
- Clean URL structure: `/work/[city]/[slug]`

const { data: jobs } = await supabase
  .from('jobs')
  .select(`
    id,
    slug,
    city,
    image_url,
    gps_fuzzy_lat,
    gps_fuzzy_lng,
    service:services(name)
  `)
  .eq('status', 'published')
  .order('published_at', { ascending: false });
```

**Job Page (fetch single job by slug):**
```typescript
const { data: job } = await supabase
  .from('jobs')
  .select(`
    id,
    slug,
    city,
    neighborhood,
    image_url,
    ai_description,
    created_at,
    published_at,
    service:services(name)
  `)
  .eq('slug', slug)
  .eq('status', 'published')
  .single();
```

### Next.js Features Used
- **Dynamic Routes**: `[city]` and `[slug]` params
- **Server Components**: All pages are server-rendered by default
- **Metadata API**: `generateMetadata()` for dynamic SEO
- **Suspense**: Loading states for auth button
- **notFound()**: Built-in 404 handling

---

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Public can only see jobs with `status = 'published'`
- Defined in `database/schema.sql`:
  ```sql
  CREATE POLICY "Published jobs are publicly readable" 
  ON jobs FOR SELECT 
  USING (status = 'published');
  ```

### GPS Fuzzing
- Map uses `gps_fuzzy_lat` and `gps_fuzzy_lng` (not exact coordinates)
- Fuzzing happens during upload (in `/api/upload`)
- Protects client privacy while still showing general area

---

## 📱 Responsive Design

### Breakpoints
- **Mobile**: < 640px (sm)
- **Tablet**: 640px - 768px (md)
- **Desktop**: > 768px (lg)

### Mobile Optimizations
- Full-height map on mobile
- Stacked CTA buttons on small screens
- Touch-friendly map controls
- Responsive image sizing
- Collapsible header on scroll

---

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in production (Vercel):
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN` - Mapbox public token
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anon key

### Mapbox Token Setup
1. Token must be a **public token** (starts with `pk.`)
2. Token should have URL restrictions in production:
   - Add your domain: `yourdomain.com`
   - Add Vercel preview domains: `*.vercel.app`
3. Scopes needed: `styles:read`, `fonts:read`, `tiles:read`

### Supabase RLS Verification
```sql
-- Test as unauthenticated user
SELECT * FROM jobs WHERE status = 'published'; -- Should work
SELECT * FROM jobs WHERE status = 'draft'; -- Should return nothing
```

### Performance Optimization
- Images already optimized via Sharp during upload
- Mapbox loads only on client-side (map is not SSR'd)
- Server components reduce JavaScript bundle size
- Consider adding Next.js Image component for further optimization

---

## 📋 Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

# SEO-Friendly Image Filenames

**Date:** January 19, 2026  
**Status:** ✅ Implemented

---

## 🎯 Feature Overview

All uploaded images (jobs and sightings) now use SEO-friendly filenames that include location and service information. This improves:
- **Image SEO**: Search engines can understand image content from filename alone
- **Google Image Search**: Better ranking for local image searches
- **Accessibility**: Descriptive filenames help screen readers and assistive tech
- **Organization**: Easy to identify images in Supabase storage

---

## 📝 Filename Formats

### Job Images
**Format:** `{service-slug}-in-{city}-{state}-{timestamp}.jpg`

**Examples:**
```
standard-carpet-cleaning-in-denver-co-1737331200.jpg
pet-urine-removal-in-monument-co-1737331245.jpg
deep-carpet-restoration-in-colorado-springs-co-1737331290.jpg
tile-and-grout-cleaning-in-boulder-co-1737331335.jpg
```

**Components:**
- `{service-slug}`: Service category from the job form (e.g., "pet-urine-removal")
- `{city}`: City name from reverse geocoding (e.g., "denver")
- `{state}`: State abbreviation from reverse geocoding (e.g., "co")
- `{timestamp}`: Unix timestamp for uniqueness (e.g., "1737331200")
- Extension: Preserved from original file (usually `.jpg` after Sharp optimization)

---

### Sighting Images
**Format:** `sasquatch-sighting-in-{city}-{state}-{timestamp}.jpg`

**Examples:**
```
sasquatch-sighting-in-denver-co-1737331200.jpg
sasquatch-sighting-in-monument-co-1737331245.jpg
sasquatch-sighting-in-colorado-springs-co-1737331290.jpg
sasquatch-sighting-in-unknown-1737331335.jpg (if geocoding fails)
```

**Components:**
- Prefix: Always `sasquatch-sighting-in`
- `{city}`: City name from reverse geocoding (defaults to "unknown" if missing)
- `{state}`: State abbreviation from reverse geocoding (optional)
- `{timestamp}`: Unix timestamp for uniqueness
- Extension: Preserved from original file

---

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### New Utility File: `src/lib/seo-filename.ts`

**Functions:**

1. **`slugify(text: string): string`**
   - Converts text to URL-safe slug format
   - Lowercase, hyphens instead of spaces
   - Removes special characters
   - Removes consecutive hyphens

2. **`generateSEOFilename(serviceSlug, city, state, originalFilename): string`**
   - Generates SEO filename for job images
   - Uses service slug from database
   - Uses location from reverse geocoding
   - Adds Unix timestamp for uniqueness

3. **`generateSightingSEOFilename(city, state, originalFilename): string`**
   - Generates SEO filename for sighting images
   - Uses location from reverse geocoding
   - Defaults to "unknown" if city is missing
   - Adds Unix timestamp for uniqueness

---

### Modified Files

#### 1. `src/app/api/upload/route.ts` (Job Uploads)

**Before:**
```typescript
const timestamp = Date.now()
const filename = `${timestamp}-${imageFile.name.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9.-]/g, '_')}`
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Reverse geocode to get city, state, and neighborhood
const { city, state, neighborhood } = await reverseGeocode(lat, lng)

// Generate SEO-friendly filename
const filename = generateSEOFilename(
  service.slug,
  city,
  state,
  imageFile.name
)
```

**Result:** `pet-urine-removal-in-monument-co-1737331200.jpg`

---

#### 2. `src/app/api/sightings/route.ts` (Sighting Uploads)

**Before:**
```typescript
const timestamp = Date.now()
const filename = `${timestamp}-${imageFile.name.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9.-]/g, '_')}`
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Reverse geocode GPS coordinates to get city and state
let city: string | null = null
let state: string | null = null

if (lat !== null && lng !== null) {
  try {
    const geocodeResult = await reverseGeocode(lat, lng)
    city = geocodeResult.city
    state = geocodeResult.state
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Geocoding error:', error)
  }
}

// Generate SEO-friendly filename
const filename = generateSightingSEOFilename(
  city,
  state,
  imageFile.name
)
```

**Result:** `sasquatch-sighting-in-denver-co-1737331200.jpg`

---

## 🔍 SEO Benefits

### 1. Google Image Search
- **Keyword-rich filenames** help Google understand image content
- **Location-specific** filenames improve local image search ranking
- **Service-specific** filenames target relevant search queries

**Example Search Queries:**
- "pet urine removal denver co"
- "carpet cleaning monument colorado"
- "sasquatch carpet cleaning truck"

### 2. Alt Text + Filename Synergy
When combined with proper `alt` attributes in HTML, SEO-friendly filenames provide:
- **Redundant signals** to search engines (filename + alt text)
- **Better accessibility** for screen readers
- **Improved context** for image recognition algorithms

### 3. Social Sharing
When images are shared on social media:
- **Descriptive filenames** appear in Open Graph image URLs
- **Professional appearance** (no random timestamps or garbled names)
- **Brand consistency** (all images follow same naming pattern)

---

## 📊 Examples in Production

### Job Page
```html
<!-- Before -->
<img src="https://supabase.co/.../1737331200-IMG_1234.jpg" 
     alt="Carpet cleaning in Denver, CO" />

<!-- After -->
<img src="https://supabase.co/.../pet-urine-removal-in-denver-co-1737331200.jpg" 
     alt="Pet urine removal carpet cleaning in Denver, CO" />
```

### Sighting Share Page
```html
<!-- Before -->
<img src="https://supabase.co/.../1737331200-photo.jpg" 
     alt="Sasquatch truck spotted in Denver, CO" />

<!-- After -->
<img src="https://supabase.co/.../sasquatch-sighting-in-denver-co-1737331200.jpg" 
     alt="Sasquatch Carpet Cleaning truck spotted in Denver, CO" />
```

---

## 🛡️ Safety & Edge Cases

### Uniqueness Guarantee
- **Unix timestamp** ensures no collisions (1-second resolution)
- **Service + location** prefix provides additional uniqueness
- **Extremely unlikely** to have duplicate filenames

### Special Character Handling
- **Spaces** → Hyphens (e.g., "Colorado Springs" → "colorado-springs")
- **Apostrophes** → Removed (e.g., "O'Fallon" → "ofallon")
- **Periods** → Removed (e.g., "St. Louis" → "st-louis")
- **Ampersands** → Removed (e.g., "Tile & Grout" → "tile-grout")

### Missing Data Fallbacks
- **No city:** Uses "unknown" (sightings only)
- **No state:** Omits state from filename (e.g., `...-in-denver-1737331200.jpg`)
- **No extension:** Defaults to `.jpg`

### Geocoding Failures
- **Sightings:** Falls back to `sasquatch-sighting-in-unknown-{timestamp}.jpg`
- **Jobs:** Should not happen (GPS required), but would use "Unknown" city
- **Submission still succeeds** even if geocoding fails

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing
1. **Upload a job** with GPS coordinates
2. **Check Supabase storage** → `job-images` bucket
3. **Verify filename format** matches pattern
4. **Check database** → `image_url` field contains SEO filename

### Example Test Cases

| Service | City | State | Expected Filename |
|---------|------|-------|-------------------|
| Standard Carpet Cleaning | Denver | CO | `standard-carpet-cleaning-in-denver-co-{timestamp}.jpg` |
| Pet Urine Removal | Monument | CO | `pet-urine-removal-in-monument-co-{timestamp}.jpg` |
| Tile & Grout Cleaning | Colorado Springs | CO | `tile-grout-cleaning-in-colorado-springs-co-{timestamp}.jpg` |

# SEO & Social Sharing Fix for Sightings App
**Date:** January 19, 2026  
**Status:** ✅ Code Complete - Ready for Deployment

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

### Symptoms
1. **Facebook/Social Previews Broken**: When sharing sighting links on Facebook, the preview card fails to display the specific image or description—just shows a generic link.
2. **Google Indexing Failure**: The subdomain `sightings.sasquatchcarpet.com` shows 0 indexed pages in Google Search, despite having content.

### Root Cause Analysis
The Sighting Detail pages (`/sightings/share/[id]`) were **partially server-side rendered**:
- ✅ **Open Graph tags** were correctly generated server-side via `generateMetadata`
- ❌ **JSON-LD structured data** was completely missing (required for Google indexing)
- ⚠️ **Location data** (city/state) was missing from the database, resulting in generic descriptions like "Colorado" instead of specific locations

---

## 🛠️ Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Enhancement
**File:** `database/migrations/add_location_to_sightings.sql`

Added two new columns to the `sightings` table:
- `city TEXT` - City name from reverse geocoding
- `state TEXT` - State abbreviation (e.g., "CO")
- Index on `city` for future filtering/search

**Migration SQL:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE sightings ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS city TEXT;
ALTER TABLE sightings ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS state TEXT;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_sightings_city ON sightings(city) WHERE city IS NOT NULL;
```

---

### 2. Reverse Geocoding Integration
**Files Modified:**
- `src/lib/geocode.ts` - Updated `GeocodeResult` type to include `state`
- `src/app/api/sightings/route.ts` - Added geocoding call during sighting submission

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Extract state from Nominatim response
const state = data.address?.state_code || data.address?.state || null

// In sightings API route
if (lat !== null && lng !== null) {
  try {
    const geocodeResult = await reverseGeocode(lat, lng)
    city = geocodeResult.city
    state = geocodeResult.state
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Geocoding error:', error)
    // Continue without location data if geocoding fails
  }
}
```

**Behavior:**
- Uses existing Nominatim (OpenStreetMap) API (per project rules)
- Extracts city and state from GPS coordinates
- Gracefully degrades if geocoding fails (submission still succeeds)
- No cost (free API with proper User-Agent header)

---

### 3. JSON-LD Structured Data
**File:** `src/app/sightings/share/[id]/page.tsx`

Added Schema.org `ImageObject` markup for Google Search:

```typescript
const jsonLd = {
  '@context': 'https://schema.org',
  '@type': 'ImageObject',
  name: `Sasquatch Carpet Cleaning Truck Spotted in ${location}`,
  description: 'Sasquatch Carpet Cleaning truck sighting photo from our community contest',
  contentUrl: sighting.image_url,
  url: `https://sightings.sasquatchcarpet.com/sightings/share/${id}`,
  datePublished: sighting.created_at,
  author: {
    '@type': 'Organization',
    name: 'Sasquatch Carpet Cleaning',
    url: 'https://sasquatchcarpet.com',
  },
  contentLocation: {
    '@type': 'Place',
    name: location,
    geo: {
      '@type': 'GeoCoordinates',
      latitude: sighting.gps_lat,
      longitude: sighting.gps_lng,
    },
  },
}
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Google Search Console requires structured data for rich results
- Provides explicit location context for local SEO
- Links sightings to the parent organization
- Includes geographic coordinates for map-based search features

---

### 4. Enhanced Open Graph Metadata
**File:** `src/app/sightings/share/[id]/page.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
const description = 'I just saw the Sasquatch Carpet Cleaning truck! Check out my photo...'
```

**After:**
```typescript
const description = `A Sasquatch Carpet Cleaning truck was spotted in ${location} on ${formattedDate}. Join our contest to win a free whole house carpet cleaning!`
```

**Additional Improvements:**
- ✅ Added `publishedTime` to Open Graph (for article freshness)
- ✅ Added Twitter `creator` and `site` tags (`@SasquatchCC`)
- ✅ Added explicit `robots` meta tags for better crawling
- ✅ Changed `siteName` to "Sasquatch Carpet Cleaning Sightings" (more specific)
- ✅ Dynamic description includes actual city/state and date

---

## 📋 Deployment Checklist

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
Connect to Supabase and run:
```sql
-- Copy contents from database/migrations/add_location_to_sightings.sql
ALTER TABLE sightings ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS city TEXT;
ALTER TABLE sightings ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS state TEXT;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_sightings_city ON sightings(city) WHERE city IS NOT NULL;
COMMENT ON COLUMN sightings.city IS 'City name from reverse geocoding (Nominatim)';
COMMENT ON COLUMN sightings.state IS 'State abbreviation (e.g., CO) from reverse geocoding';
```

### Step 2: Commit and Push Code
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: Add SEO improvements for sighting share pages

- Add city/state columns to sightings table
- Integrate reverse geocoding (Nominatim) for location data
- Add JSON-LD structured data (Schema.org ImageObject)
- Enhance Open Graph metadata with dynamic descriptions
- Add Twitter card metadata and robots tags"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
1. Wait for Vercel deployment to complete
2. Test a sighting share page: `https://sightings.sasquatchcarpet.com/sightings/share/[id]`
3. Verify Open Graph tags using [Facebook Sharing Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/)
4. Verify JSON-LD using [Google Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results)

### Step 4: Submit to Google Search Console
1. Log into [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Submit sitemap (if not already done): `https://sightings.sasquatchcarpet.com/sitemap.xml`
3. Request indexing for 2-3 sample sighting URLs
4. Monitor indexing status over next 48-72 hours

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Local Testing (Before Deployment)
1. ✅ Submit a new test sighting with GPS coordinates
2. ✅ Verify `city` and `state` are populated in database
3. ✅ Check share page renders with correct location
4. ✅ Inspect page source to confirm JSON-LD is present
5. ✅ Verify Open Graph tags in `<head>`

### Production Testing (After Deployment)
1. **Facebook Debugger**: Paste share URL and verify:
   - Image loads correctly
   - Title shows specific location
   - Description includes date and location
2. **Google Rich Results Test**: Verify JSON-LD is valid
3. **View Page Source**: Confirm metadata is in initial HTML (not injected by JS)
4. **Submit to Google**: Request indexing for 3-5 URLs

---

## 📊 Expected Outcomes

### Immediate (24-48 hours)
- ✅ Facebook/social previews display correctly with images
- ✅ Google Rich Results Test validates structured data
- ✅ Share pages have location-specific titles and descriptions

### Short-term (1-2 weeks)
- ✅ Google Search Console shows indexed pages (target: 10-20 sightings)
- ✅ Rich results appear in Google Search (image thumbnails, location)
- ✅ Social shares generate higher click-through rates

### Long-term (1-3 months)
- ✅ Subdomain ranks for local queries like "sasquatch carpet cleaning [city]"
- ✅ Sighting pages contribute to overall domain authority
- ✅ Contest submissions increase due to better social sharing

---

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Server-Side Rendering Verification
All metadata is now **fully server-side rendered**:
- `generateMetadata` runs on the server (Next.js App Router)
- `getSighting` uses `@/supabase/server` (server-side Supabase client)
- JSON-LD is injected as static HTML in the initial response
- No client-side `useEffect` or JavaScript required for bots

### Geocoding Rate Limits
Nominatim Usage Policy:
- **Rate Limit**: 1 request/second (we're well below this)
- **User-Agent Required**: ✅ Set to `SasquatchJobPinner/1.0`
- **Caching**: Results stored in database (no repeat requests)
- **Fallback**: Submissions succeed even if geocoding fails

### Browser Compatibility
- JSON-LD: Supported by all major search engines (Google, Bing, Yandex)
- Open Graph: Supported by Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Slack, Discord
- Twitter Cards: Native support on X/Twitter platform

---

## 🚨 Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If issues arise after deployment:

1. **Database Rollback**:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE sightings DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS city;
   ALTER TABLE sightings DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS state;
   DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_sightings_city;
   ```

2. **Code Rollback**:
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Verify**: Old sightings still work (new columns are nullable)

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### **File:** `src/app/sitemap.ts`

**Key Features:**
- Uses Next.js 16 App Router `MetadataRoute.Sitemap` type
- Fetches data from Supabase (jobs and sightings tables)
- Generates city slug from job.city field
- Includes proper lastModified dates
- Revalidates every hour (3600 seconds)

**Code Structure:**
```typescript
export default async function sitemap(): Promise<MetadataRoute.Sitemap> {
  // 1. Fetch published jobs from Supabase
  // 2. Fetch all sightings from Supabase
  // 3. Generate static pages array
  // 4. Map jobs to URLs with city/slug format
  // 5. Map sightings to share page URLs
  // 6. Combine and return all URLs
}

export const revalidate = 3600 // Revalidate every hour
```

---

## 🔄 Automatic Updates

### **Revalidation Strategy**

The sitemap automatically updates:
- **Every 1 hour** (via `revalidate = 3600`)
- **On new deployment** (Vercel rebuilds)
- **On-demand** (Google/Bing can request fresh copy)

### **What Triggers Updates**

New URLs appear automatically when:
- ✅ Admin publishes a new job
- ✅ User submits a sighting
- ✅ Existing job/sighting is updated

No manual intervention needed!

- **Ongoing:** New pages indexed within 24 hours

---

## 🔧 Maintenance

### **No Action Required**

The sitemap maintains itself automatically:
- ✅ New jobs/sightings appear automatically
- ✅ Deleted content removed automatically (via database queries)
- ✅ Timestamps update based on database values
- ✅ Revalidation happens every hour

### **Monitoring (Optional)**

Occasionally check:
1. **Sitemap accessible:** https://sightings.sasquatchcarpet.com/sitemap.xml
2. **Google Search Console:** Sitemap status and errors
3. **URL count:** Should match published jobs + sightings count

---

## 📊 Expected Impact

### **Short-term (1-2 weeks)**
- ✅ All pages discovered by Google
- ✅ Sitemap shows in Google Search Console
- ✅ Crawl rate increases

### **Medium-term (1-3 months)**
- ✅ Most pages indexed
- ✅ Improved ranking for local queries
- ✅ Sighting pages appear in search results

### **Long-term (3-6 months)**
- ✅ Complete indexing of all historical content
- ✅ Consistent indexing of new content
- ✅ Improved domain authority

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Sitemap returns 404**
**Solution:** Make sure `src/app/sitemap.ts` is deployed

### **Issue: Sitemap is empty**
**Possible causes:**
1. No published jobs in database
2. Supabase connection error
3. RLS policies blocking query

**Debug:**
```typescript
// Add console.log to sitemap.ts
console.log('Jobs:', jobs?.length)
console.log('Sightings:', sightings?.length)
```

### **Issue: URLs not updating**
**Solution:** Wait for revalidation (1 hour) or force redeploy

### **Issue: Google shows errors**
**Common fixes:**
- Verify all URLs are accessible (not 404)
- Check robots.txt isn't blocking pages
- Ensure proper authentication (public pages)

# SMS Future Features

## Overview
This document contains SMS feature ideas that require more planning, discussion, or infrastructure before implementation. These are parked for future consideration.

---

## 🔮 Future Features (Not Building Yet)

### 1. SMS Opt-Out Tracking

**The Problem:**
- By law (TCPA), customers must be able to opt out of SMS
- Need to track who has opted out and never text them again

**How It Would Work:**
```
Customer replies: "STOP"
↓
Your app receives it via Twilio webhook
↓
Mark lead as opted out in database
↓
All future SMS checks opt-out status first
```

**Technical Requirements:**
- Add `sms_opted_out` boolean column to `leads` table
- Add `sms_opted_out_at` timestamp column
- Create `/api/sms/incoming` webhook endpoint
- Configure Twilio to send inbound SMS to this endpoint
- Parse replies for STOP, UNSUBSCRIBE, etc.
- Update lead record when opt-out detected

**Questions to Answer:**
- What other keywords besides STOP? (UNSUBSCRIBE, CANCEL, END, QUIT)
- Should we send confirmation? "You're unsubscribed from Sasquatch SMS"
- Can they opt back in? How?
- Do we need opt-in consent tracking too?

---

### 2. Partner Text-In Referrals

**The Idea:**
Partners can text referral info directly to your Twilio number, and it auto-creates the referral in your system.

**How It Would Work:**
```
Partner texts: "John Smith 303-555-1234 needs carpet cleaning"
↓
Your app receives it via Twilio webhook
↓
AI/parser extracts: name, phone, notes
↓
Looks up which partner sent it (by their phone number)
↓
Creates referral automatically
↓
Sends confirmation to partner
↓
Sends auto-response to customer
↓
Sends admin notification to you
```

**Example Flow:**
1. Partner (Sarah, 720-555-9999): "Mike Johnson 303-123-4567 - 3 bedroom house in Denver"
2. System creates referral linked to Sarah
3. Sarah gets: "✅ Referral received for Mike Johnson!"
4. Mike gets: "Thanks for reaching out! Sarah recommended us. Book now: [link]"
5. You get: "🤝 Sarah just texted in a referral: Mike Johnson - (303) 123-4567"

**Technical Requirements:**
- Inbound SMS webhook endpoint (`/api/sms/incoming`)
- Phone number lookup to identify which partner sent it
- Text parsing/AI to extract name and phone number
- Validation to ensure required info is present
- Error handling for malformed messages
- Response messages for success/failure

**Questions to Answer:**
- What format should partners use? Free-form or structured?
- Should we use AI (Claude/GPT) to parse free-form text?
- What if we can't identify the sender? (Not in partners table)
- What if parsing fails? Send error message back?
- Should partners be trained on a specific format?
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse?

**Suggested Message Format for Partners:**
```
REFERRAL: John Smith, 303-555-1234, needs 2 bedrooms cleaned
```
Or just free-form and use AI to parse it.

---

### 3. Two-Way SMS Conversations

**The Idea:**
Customers can reply to your SMS and you see their responses in your admin dashboard (or get forwarded to your phone).

**How It Would Work:**

**Option A: Admin Dashboard Display**
```
Customer replies to nurture SMS: "Yes, interested! Call me tomorrow."
↓
Stored in database linked to their lead
↓
Shows up in admin leads page as a conversation thread
↓
You can reply from admin panel
```

**Option B: Forward to Your Phone**
```
Customer replies: "Yes, interested!"
↓
You get SMS at (719) 249-8791: "Lead [Name] replied: Yes, interested!"
↓
You text them back directly from your phone
```

**Option C: Hybrid**
- You get immediate notification SMS
- Conversation also logged in admin dashboard
- You can reply from either place

**Technical Requirements:**
- Inbound SMS webhook (`/api/sms/incoming`)
- Database table for SMS conversations/threads
- UI in admin panel to view conversations
- Reply functionality from admin panel
- Link replies to correct lead record
- Handle unknown senders (not in database yet)

**Questions to Answer:**
- Do we need a full conversation UI or just notifications?
- Should replies create tasks/reminders for you?
- What about spam/wrong numbers?
- Should we auto-reply to unknown numbers?
- Track conversation history per lead?

---

### 4. Smart Reply Detection

**The Idea:**
Detect certain replies and trigger automatic actions.

**Examples:**

**Reply: "YES" or "INTERESTED"**
- Auto-update lead status to "interested"
- Send you notification
- Send customer: "Great! We'll call you today. Or book now: [link]"

**Reply: "CALL ME"**
- Update lead status to "requested_callback"
- Send you urgent notification
- Add to your call queue
- Send customer: "Got it! We'll call you within 2 hours."

**Reply: "NOT INTERESTED"**
- Update lead status to "lost"
- Stop sending nurture SMS
- Send customer: "No problem! If you change your mind: [link]"

**Reply: Question (detected by "?" character)**
- Forward to you immediately
- Send customer: "Thanks for your question! We'll respond shortly."

**Technical Requirements:**
- Inbound SMS webhook
- Keyword/pattern detection (or AI)
- Action mapping (keyword → what to do)
- Status updates in database
- Smart auto-responses

---

### 5. Scheduled SMS Campaigns

**The Idea:**
Send one-time promotional SMS to specific segments of your leads.

**Examples:**
- "Spring Cleaning Special: $40 off this week only!"
- Send to all leads with status 'lost' from last 6 months
- Or all leads that haven't booked yet

**How It Would Work:**
```
Admin dashboard → Campaigns tab
↓
Select segment: "Leads - Lost - Last 6 months"
↓
Write message
↓
Preview recipient count
↓
Schedule send time
↓
Sends to all matching leads (who haven't opted out)
```

**Technical Requirements:**
- Campaign management UI
- Lead segmentation/filtering
- Scheduled send logic
- Bulk SMS sending (respects rate limits)
- Opt-out checking
- Campaign tracking (opens, clicks, conversions)

**Questions to Answer:**
- How often should campaigns be allowed?
- Cost considerations (SMS fees per message)
- Compliance with TCPA regulations
- Preview/testing before sending to everyone

---

### 6. SMS Analytics Dashboard

**The Idea:**
Track SMS performance metrics to optimize messaging.

**Metrics to Track:**
- Total SMS sent (by type: nurture, referral, etc.)
- Delivery rate
- Response rate
- Opt-out rate
- Cost per SMS
- Conversions from SMS (bookings)
- Best performing messages
- Best times to send

**How It Would Work:**
- Log every SMS sent to database
- Track delivery status (via Twilio webhooks)
- Track replies/engagement
- Link to booking conversions
- Display charts/graphs in admin dashboard

**Technical Requirements:**
- `sms_logs` database table
- Twilio delivery webhook integration
- Analytics calculation logic
- Dashboard UI with charts
- Date range filtering
- Export to CSV

---

### 7. Multi-Language SMS Support

**The Idea:**
Detect customer's preferred language and send SMS in that language.

**How It Would Work:**
- Store language preference in leads table (detected from form submission or previous interaction)
- Maintain message templates in multiple languages
- Send appropriate language version

**Questions to Answer:**
- What languages? (Spanish most likely)
- How to detect language preference?
- Who translates the messages?
- Does HouseCall Pro booking link work in Spanish?

---

## 🤔 Open Questions

These questions need answers before building any of the above:

1. **Inbound SMS Priority:**
   - Which inbound SMS feature is most valuable?
   - Partner text-in referrals?

**Technical Implementation:**

**Option A: Vercel Cron Job (Recommended)**
- Create `src/app/api/cron/nurture-leads/route.ts`
- Add to `vercel.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "crons": [{
      "path": "/api/cron/nurture-leads",
      "schedule": "0 9 * * *"
    }]
  }
  ```
- Runs daily at 9 AM
- Queries leads table for leads created 3, 7, or 14 days ago
- Checks if SMS already sent for that day (need to track this)
- Sends appropriate SMS

**Option B: External Cron (Alternative)**
- Use a service like cron-job.org to hit the endpoint daily
- Same logic as Option A

**Database Changes Needed:**
Add to `leads` table:
```sql
ALTER TABLE leads
ADD COLUMN day_3_sms_sent_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
ADD COLUMN day_7_sms_sent_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
ADD COLUMN day_14_sms_sent_at TIMESTAMPTZ;
```

This tracks when each nurture SMS was sent to prevent duplicates.

---

## 📁 Files to Create/Modify

**Expected:** All posts appear (may take a few minutes)

---

## 📝 PHASE 3: REGRESSION TESTING

**Goal:** Ensure nothing broke

### Test 3.1: Job Upload Still Works
- [ ] Login to admin: http://localhost:3000/protected
- [ ] Upload a job (carpet cleaning work photo)
- [ ] Verify job appears on map
- [ ] Check job detail page works

**Expected:** Job system unaffected

---

### Test 3.2: Map Display

## 🚨 KNOWN ISSUES TO WATCH FOR

### Issue 1: Google API Rate Limits
**Symptom:** "429 Too Many Requests" error  
**Cause:** Too many test submissions  
**Solution:** Wait 1 hour or use production sparingly

### Issue 2: Invalid Google Credentials
**Symptom:** "401 Unauthorized" or "Invalid credentials"  
**Cause:** Wrong Client ID/Secret or expired refresh token  
**Solution:** Re-run `scripts/get-google-tokens.js`

### Issue 3: Missing Google Business Profile
**Symptom:** "No location found for this account"  
**Cause:** Google account doesn't have a Business Profile  
**Solution:** Create one at business.google.com

### Issue 4: Image URL Not Accessible
**Symptom:** Google post created but no image shows  
**Cause:** Supabase storage URL not publicly accessible  
**Solution:** Verify `sighting-images` bucket is public

**Start with Step 1** - test OneSignal notifications first since that's the easiest to verify!
# Twilio SMS Notification Integration Plan

## Context

We are **replacing OneSignal push notifications with Twilio SMS** for the Sasquatch Sightings application. 

### Why the Change?

1. **OneSignal isn't working reliably** - especially on Safari/iPhone (user's primary device)
2. **SMS is more reliable** - works regardless of browser, device, or whether the app is open
3. **Better for partner notifications** - can send texts to partners when they get referrals
4. **User preference** - Chuck prefers SMS for instant alerts

### Current State

- ✅ OneSignal is already integrated (client + server code exists)
- ✅ OneSignal subscription works on desktop Chrome
- ❌ OneSignal notifications NOT appearing (likely Safari/iOS issues)
- ✅ Lead creation works perfectly (contest entries show in Lead Tracker)
- ✅ Server-side notification code is in place but needs to be switched to Twilio

## What Needs to Be Built

### 1. SMS Alerts for Admin (Chuck)

Send SMS to Chuck's phone number when:
- 🏆 **New contest entry** submitted
- 📞 **Missed call** from RingCentral (already has webhook setup)
- 🤝 **New partner referral** created

**Example SMS:**
```
🎯 New Contest Entry
John Smith - (555) 123-4567
Location: Denver, CO
[Link to lead]
```

### 2. SMS Alerts for Partners

Send SMS to partners when they receive a referral:
```
🎉 New Referral!
[Customer Name] mentioned you
We'll be in touch soon
- Sasquatch Carpet Cleaning
```

## Technical Implementation

### Required Environment Variables

Add to Vercel + `.env.local`:

```bash
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid_here
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_phone_number
ADMIN_PHONE_NUMBER=chucks_phone_number  # For admin alerts
```

### Files to Create/Modify

#### 1. Create: `src/lib/twilio.ts`

Helper function for sending SMS:

```typescript
import twilio from 'twilio';

const accountSid = process.env.TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID;
const authToken = process.env.TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN;
const twilioPhone = process.env.TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER;
const adminPhone = process.env.ADMIN_PHONE_NUMBER;

const client = twilio(accountSid, authToken);

export async function sendAdminSMS(message: string): Promise<void> {
  if (!accountSid || !authToken || !twilioPhone || !adminPhone) {
    console.warn('Twilio credentials not configured');
    return;
  }

  try {
    await client.messages.create({
      body: message,
      from: twilioPhone,
      to: adminPhone,
    });
    console.log('Admin SMS sent successfully');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to send admin SMS:', error);
  }
}

export async function sendPartnerSMS(
  partnerPhone: string,
  message: string
): Promise<void> {
  if (!accountSid || !authToken || !twilioPhone) {
    console.warn('Twilio credentials not configured');
    return;
  }

  try {
    await client.messages.create({
      body: message,
      from: twilioPhone,
      to: partnerPhone,
    });
    console.log(`Partner SMS sent to ${partnerPhone}`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to send partner SMS:', error);
  }
}
```

#### 2. Modify: `src/app/api/sightings/route.ts`

Replace OneSignal call (line ~216) with Twilio:

```typescript
import { sendAdminSMS } from '@/lib/twilio'

// Replace the sendOneSignalNotification call with:
await sendAdminSMS(
  `🏆 New Contest Entry\n${fullName} - ${phoneNumber}\n${locationText || city || 'Unknown location'}`
)
```

#### 3. Modify: `src/app/api/leads/route.ts`

For missed calls from RingCentral (line ~80-90):

```typescript
await sendAdminSMS(
  `📞 Missed Call\n${name || 'Unknown'} - ${formatPhoneDisplay(phone)}`
)
```

#### 4. Modify: `src/app/api/admin/referrals/route.ts`

For partner referrals (add SMS to both admin AND partner):

```typescript
import { sendAdminSMS, sendPartnerSMS } from '@/lib/twilio'

// After lead creation, send to admin:
await sendAdminSMS(
  `🤝 New Partner Referral\n${name} - ${formatPhoneDisplay(phone)}\nReferred by: ${partner.name}`
)

// Also notify the partner:
if (partner.phone) {
  await sendPartnerSMS(
    partner.phone,
    `🎉 New Referral!\n${name} mentioned you as their preferred partner.\nWe'll be in touch soon!\n- Sasquatch Carpet Cleaning`
  )
}
```

### Dependencies

Install Twilio SDK:

```bash
npm install twilio
```

## Setup Steps

### 1. Twilio Account Setup

If Chuck doesn't have a Twilio account:

1. Go to https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio
2. Sign up for free trial (gives $15 credit)
3. Verify Chuck's phone number during signup
4. Get a Twilio phone number (free with trial)
5. Copy credentials from console:
   - Account SID
   - Auth Token
   - Twilio Phone Number

### 2. Configuration

1. Add environment variables to Vercel (Settings → Environment Variables)
2. Add same variables to local `.env.local`
3. Mark all variables for: Production, Preview, Development

### 3. Testing

1. Submit a contest entry
2. Check if Chuck receives SMS
3. Create a partner referral (test partner SMS if partner has phone number)
4. Trigger a missed call webhook (if RingCentral is set up)

## What to Do with OneSignal

### Option 1: Remove Completely

- Delete `src/components/onesignal-init.tsx`
- Remove from `src/app/admin/layout.tsx`
- Delete `src/lib/onesignal.ts`
- Remove env vars: `ONESIGNAL_APP_ID`, `ONESIGNAL_API_KEY`

### Option 2: Keep as Backup (Recommended)

- Leave OneSignal code in place
- Keep it in admin layout for desktop users
- Add SMS alongside it (both will fire)
- Desktop users get visual notification + Chuck gets SMS

## Current File Locations

**Existing files that reference OneSignal:**
- `src/lib/onesignal.ts` - Server-side OneSignal API calls
- `src/components/onesignal-init.tsx` - Client-side OneSignal SDK
- `src/app/admin/layout.tsx` - Loads OneSignalInit component
- `src/app/api/sightings/route.ts` - Calls sendOneSignalNotification
- `src/app/api/leads/route.ts` - Calls sendOneSignalNotification  
- `src/app/api/admin/referrals/route.ts` - Calls sendOneSignalNotification

**Branch:**
- Feature branch: `feature/onesignal-admin-notifications` (merged to main)
- Currently on: `main` branch

## Important Notes

- Chuck's primary device is **iPhone with Safari** (OneSignal doesn't work well)
- Phone number format in database: stored as `(XXX) XXX-XXXX`
- Partners have optional phone numbers in the `partners` table
- The `leads` table has a unique constraint on phone numbers (duplicates will fail silently)
- Admin phone number needs to be in E.164 format for Twilio: `+1XXXXXXXXXX`

## Testing Checklist

After implementation:

- [ ] Contest entry triggers SMS to admin
- [ ] SMS includes: name, phone, location
- [ ] Partner referral triggers SMS to admin
- [ ] Partner referral triggers SMS to partner
- [ ] Missed call (RingCentral) triggers SMS to admin
- [ ] No errors in Vercel logs
- [ ] Graceful failure if Twilio creds missing

## Questions for Chuck

Before starting:

1. **Do you have a Twilio account?** (YES/NO)
2. **What's your phone number for receiving alerts?** (format: +1XXXXXXXXXX)
3. **Keep OneSignal as backup or remove it?** (KEEP/REMOVE)

## Next Steps

1. Get Twilio credentials from Chuck
2. Install `twilio` npm package
3. Create `src/lib/twilio.ts`
4. Replace OneSignal calls with SMS calls
5. Add environment variables to Vercel
6. Test with real submission
7. Deploy to production

# ⚠️ RingCentral JWT Setup Required

## What You Need

RingCentral uses **JWT authentication** with a private key. You need to download this key from their Developer Console.

---

## Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Download Your Private Key

1. Go to **https://developers.ringcentral.com/**
2. Log in with: `sasquatchcc719@gmail.com`
3. Go to **"My Apps"** → Select your app (or create a "Server/Bot" app)
4. Go to **"Credentials"** tab
5. Under **"JWT Credentials"**, click **"Create/Download Private Key"**
6. A file called `private_key.pem` will download

### Step 2: Add Private Key to `.env.local`

1. Open `private_key.pem` in a text editor
2. Copy the **entire content** (including BEGIN/END lines)
3. Open `.env.local`
4. Find `RINGCENTRAL_JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` and paste your key:

```bash
RINGCENTRAL_JWT_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
MIIEowIBAAKCAQEA1234567890abcdef...
(many lines)
...your key...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
```

### Step 3: Run the Setup

```bash
node setup-ringcentral-webhook-jwt.js
```

Expected output:
```

# Server-Side Upload Pipeline - Implementation Summary

## 📦 What Was Built

### 1. **`/src/lib/geocode.ts`** - Reverse Geocoding Utility
**Function:** `reverseGeocode(lat, lng)`

**Features:**
- Uses OpenStreetMap Nominatim API (per .cursorrules - NOT Mapbox)
- Endpoint: `https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/reverse`
- Required User-Agent header: "SasquatchJobPinner/1.0"
- Extracts city from: `address.city`, `address.town`, `address.village`, or `address.municipality`
- Extracts neighborhood (optional) from: `address.neighbourhood` or `address.suburb`
- Returns fallback values ("Unknown", null) on error

**Example Response:**
```typescript
{
  city: "Monument",
  neighborhood: "Fox Run" | null
}
```

---

### 2. **`/src/lib/slug.ts`** - URL Slug Generation
**Function:** `generateJobSlug(serviceName, city)`

**Format:** `[service-slug]-[city]-[date]-[short-id]`

**Features:**
- Converts to lowercase
- Removes special characters (only a-z, 0-9, hyphens)
- Includes ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Adds 6-character random ID for uniqueness

**Example Output:**
```
"urine-treatment-monument-2025-01-11-a1b2c3"
```

---

### 3. **`/src/app/api/upload/route.ts`** - Upload API Endpoint
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/upload`

**Complete Data Flow:**
1. ✅ **Authentication check** - Verifies user is logged in
2. ✅ **Parse form data** - Image, serviceId, GPS coordinates, voice note
3. ✅ **Validate inputs** - Required fields check
4. ✅ **Get service details** - Fetch service name for slug
5. ✅ **Reverse geocode** - Get city & neighborhood from GPS
6. ✅ **Sharp optimization** - Resize to max 1920px, 85% quality JPEG
7. ✅ **Upload to Supabase Storage** - `job-images` bucket
8. ✅ **Generate fuzzed GPS** - Offset ~200m for privacy
9. ✅ **Generate job slug** - URL-friendly identifier
10. ✅ **Insert job record** - Create draft job in database
11. ✅ **Return success** - Job ID, slug, city, neighborhood, image URL

**Request Format:**
```typescript
FormData {
  image: File (compressed JPEG)
  serviceId: string (UUID)
  gpsLat: string (latitude)
  gpsLng: string (longitude)
  voiceNote?: string (optional)
}
```

**Response Format:**
```typescript
{
  success: true,
  job: {
    id: string,
    slug: string,
    city: string,
    neighborhood: string | null,
    imageUrl: string
  }
}
```

**Error Responses:**
- 401: Unauthorized (not logged in)
- 400: Missing required fields or invalid service
- 500: Server error (storage upload failed or database insert failed)

---

### 4. **Updated `/src/components/admin/upload-form.tsx`**

**New Features:**
- ✅ Real API integration (replaces console.log)
- ✅ FormData preparation with all required fields
- ✅ GPS validation before submit
- ✅ Loading state during upload
- ✅ Error handling with user-friendly messages
- ✅ Success message with auto-redirect
- ✅ Disabled form during upload
- ✅ 2-second delay before page reload (shows success message)

**New State Variables:**
- `isUploading` - Shows loading spinner on submit button
- `uploadError` - Displays error messages
- `uploadSuccess` - Shows success message

**Enhanced Submit Handler:**
```typescript
async onSubmit(data) {
  // 1. Validate GPS coordinates exist
  // 2. Validate compressed file exists
  // 3. Prepare FormData
  // 4. Send to /api/upload
  // 5. Handle response
  // 6. Show success/error
  // 7. Reload page on success
}
```

**UI Updates:**
- Submit button shows "Uploading..." with spinner
- Error messages in red destructive banner
- Success message in green banner with checkmark
- Button disabled during upload and after success

## 🎯 Complete Data Pipeline

### Client Side (Form):
1. User selects image → EXIF extraction → Compression (browser-image-compression)
2. GPS from EXIF or device location
3. User selects service type and adds notes
4. Form submits to `/api/upload`

### Server Side (API):
5. Authentication check
6. Reverse geocode (Nominatim)
7. Image optimization (Sharp)
8. Upload to Supabase Storage
9. Generate fuzzed GPS coordinates
10. Generate URL slug
11. Insert draft job record
12. Return success response

### Result:
- ✅ Image optimized and stored
- ✅ Job record created with status: 'draft'
- ✅ GPS coordinates stored (actual + fuzzed)
- ✅ City and neighborhood extracted
- ✅ URL slug generated
- ✅ Ready for AI description generation (Phase 3)

## 📋 Database Record Created

```sql
INSERT INTO jobs (
  service_id,
  image_url,
  image_filename,
  gps_lat,              -- Actual GPS
  gps_lng,              -- Actual GPS
  gps_fuzzy_lat,        -- Fuzzed for public display
  gps_fuzzy_lng,        -- Fuzzed for public display
  city,                 -- From Nominatim
  neighborhood,         -- From Nominatim (optional)
  raw_voice_input,      -- Voice notes
  slug,                 -- URL identifier
  status                -- 'draft'
) VALUES (...)
```

---

## ✅ Following .cursorrules

- ✅ **RULE 1**: Using documented patterns (Next.js Route Handlers, Supabase API, Sharp, Nominatim)
- ✅ **RULE 2**: Files in correct structure (`src/lib/`, `src/app/api/`)
- ✅ **RULE 3**: One feature at a time (upload pipeline only)
- ✅ **RULE 5**: Using exact Nominatim API syntax from docs
- ✅ **Data Flow**: Following exact flow from .cursorrules
- ✅ **Nominatim**: Using OSM (NOT Mapbox) per TOS requirements
- ✅ **Sharp**: Server-side optimization after client compression
- ✅ **Draft Status**: Not auto-publishing (human review required)
